#  Config file explanation
# First Server block
# [::]: =>According to nginx docs, these square brackets [::]: are for IPv6 .
# server_name => routing following domain.
# return 301 => HTTP status code 301 makes redirection to HTTPS automatically.
# 2. Second Server block
# Setting SSL Key and autoindex is optional.
# root => if server_name domain exists, you can set the root folder.
# index => set following files as index files.
# first location block=> Since Nginx doesnâ€™t support static file hosting as default, looking for file in the folder followed by uri within root folder. If cannot find this file, it shows 404(page not found) error.
# second location block=> This enables php program connected with Nginx. php-fpm stands for PHP FastCGI Process Manager.
